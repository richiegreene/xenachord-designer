/* =====================================================================
 *  SCALE / TUNING  —  what pitch each key carries
 * =====================================================================
 *
 * Design says how the keyboard is ARRANGED; this says what it SOUNDS.  The
 * two are kept apart on purpose: a layout is a run of 32 keys with an equave
 * measured off the first seven whites and the gaps among them, and nothing in
 * it knows a frequency.  Here that run is handed a scale — an equal division,
 * or a pitch typed onto every degree — and every key comes away with a pitch,
 * a name, and the enumeration it already had to hang them on. A key shows one
 * of the two at a time: its position while you are in Design, its pitch while
 * you are in Play, because both at once is two numbers in twenty pixels.
 *
 * AUTO AND CUSTOM ARE ONE MECHANISM, NOT TWO.  Every degree carries an
 * ENTRY — a ratio, a cents figure, or a step of some division — and the two
 * systems differ only in where the entry comes from.  Auto reads it off the
 * arrangement: degree d is step d of the division Design already implies, and
 * there is nothing to type.  Custom starts from exactly those entries and
 * lets any of them be replaced by hand.  So switching between the two is not
 * a change of tuning, it is a change of who is allowed to write on it, and a
 * Custom scale you have not edited sounds identical to Auto — which is what
 * makes editing it feel like editing rather than starting over.
 *
 * THAT IS WHY THE EDITOR IS THE KEYBOARD.  A scale typed into a box beside
 * the strip has to be read back onto the strip in your head, and the layouts
 * worth reaching for here are the ones whose degrees DON'T ascend in order.
 * Typed onto the key it will be played from, a nonsequential layout is no
 * harder to write than a sequential one.
 *
 * THE NOTATION IS NOT REIMPLEMENTED.  The spellers under ./notation are the
 * Notation app's own engines, copied across whole: the same Ups-and-Downs
 * table, the same C-anchored HEJI speller and the same Sagittal calculator,
 * drawing the same glyphs out of the same fonts at the same sizes the Tuner
 * draws them.  A name spelled here is the name that app would spell.  Which
 * of them a key is spelled with follows from WHAT WAS TYPED on it: a ratio is
 * spelled in HEJI, Sagittal or as itself, a step of a division in ups and
 * downs or as its number, and a bare cents figure as cents, because there is
 * no notation that answers all three and pretending otherwise would put a
 * name on a key that the key does not have.
 *
 * WHAT A TRANSPOSITION IS, AND WHY IT CHANGES NO NAME.  Transpose, in the
 * MIDI panel, is here rather than there, because it is a fact about the
 * instrument and not about a cable: a key sounds the same whether a finger or
 * a controller pressed it, so the shift has to live where the pitches are
 * settled.  What it does is multiply every pitch on the instrument by ONE
 * interval.  Every key keeps the degree it had and therefore keeps the name
 * it had; only the Hz move.  That is the whole of what a transposition is,
 * and it is why this is the one control in Play that cannot change a
 * spelling — the strip reads identically at +2 as it does at 0.
 *
 * AND THE INTERVAL IS CHOSEN IN KEYS, because keys are what a MIDI note
 * number counts in.  One press moves by however far `n` keys reach from 1/1,
 * and `n` defaults to Design's Notes in Scale — at which it is exactly an
 * equave, which is why the control is called one.  Set it smaller and the
 * instrument transposes by a fifth, or a step, without any of the keys
 * changing what they are.  It is NOT a rotation: a rotation slides the scale
 * along the keyboard and puts a different degree under your finger; this
 * leaves every finger on the degree it was on and moves the register.
 *
 * A rotation by a whole equave WOULD sound identical, which is exactly why
 * the two are kept apart: the rotation below is folded back into the scale on
 * every pass, precisely so that "which degree is under key 0" stays a
 * question with N answers rather than infinitely many.  So the shift is its
 * own term, added after the fold, and the two controls do not interfere:
 * rotate to choose the mode, transpose to choose the register.
 *
 * WHAT A ROTATION IS.  Not a transposition and not a re-ordering: the scale
 * keeps its degrees in their order and keeps their frequencies, and the whole
 * run slides along the keyboard, so a different degree comes to rest under
 * key 0.  Sliding by a whole scale carries you up an equave, which is why the
 * offset is read as a signed index into an infinite ascending run rather than
 * folded first — key 0 at rotation N is an equave above key 0 at rotation 0.
 *
 * The pitches this settles are held on window.XTuning.freqs, keyed by the
 * enumeration, because sounding them is Play's next job and it will want them
 * without having to ask the strip.
