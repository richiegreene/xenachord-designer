 * Layout engine, mesh assembly, STL / ZIP export and the Blender Python log.

 *
 * THE INSTRUMENT IS FIXED AT 32 KEYS.  One AKM320: spine half A + half B,
 * 16 sensor feet on each, 32 feet in total, one key per foot, never more.
 * The white-key count is therefore DERIVED from the pattern, not chosen.
 *
 * A design is:
 *   scale      the size number s — every width is linear in it
 *   rotation   which of the seven period slots white #0 starts on
 *   template   7 entries, each null or an array of key-type names
 *   overrides  per-absolute-slot replacements  { slotIndex: names|null }

   *  The one you want to come out well: the playing surface.  Printed   *
   *  the way the app draws it, a key's top is the LAST thing the        *
   *  printer lays down — stepped over the curve of the sides, supported *
   *  by nothing, and carrying every seam.  Turned over it is the FIRST  *
   *  thing, ironed flat against the glass, and the parts that come out  *
   *  rough are the tongue and the underside, which nobody touches.      *
   *                                                                     *
   *  A WHITE IS A HALF TURN.  Its playing surface is one flat plane at  *
   *  z = 8.628, so 180 degrees about x puts it on the bed exactly.      *
   *                                                                     *
   *  AN ACCIDENTAL IS NOT.  Black and gray tops are RAKED — they rise   *
   *  about two degrees from the spine to the peak before the nose ramps *
   *  away — so a half turn leaves them resting on one edge, rocking,    *
   *  and printing the surface that matters as a 2 degree overhang off a *
   *  line of contact.  The turn is therefore a half turn LESS THE RAKE, *
   *  and it is that raked plane that lands flat on the glass.           *
   *                                                                     *
   *  THE RAKE IS MEASURED, NOT DECLARED.  It comes off the profiles     *
   *  that were actually built — the largest upward-facing plane among   *
   *  the topmost surfaces of that colour's KEYS, which is the surface   *
   *  that will touch the bed once it is turned over.  So it is right    *
   *  for whatever the design placed, it is unmoved by the bevel (which  *
   *  trims the top's edges without tilting it), and a colour holding    *
   *  two types whose rakes differ by a tenth of a degree is laid on the *
   *  area-weighted mean of the two rather than on either.               *
   *                                                                     *
   *  THE SPINE BAND GOES WITH IT.  The band is fused to its keys and    *
   *  prints as one solid with them, so it takes the same turn and ends  *
   *  up two degrees off level.  That is the right way round: the        *
   *  playing surface is the one that has to be flat, and the band's own *
   *  faces are glued, not touched.                                      *

   *  notch cut through all of them.  So they are turned, folded and set *
   *  down TOGETHER, in a frame measured over the whole build — open all *
   *  three in a slicer and they land as the instrument, in register.    *

   *  own drop to the origin: white lies on its flat tops at 180 deg and *
   *  the raked blacks and grays at about 178, so the three came out     *
   *  two degrees apart and each shoved into the same corner.  Every     *
   *  feature the colours SHARE then disagreed — the notch stood in a    *
   *  different place in each file and no bolt hole lined up with its    *
   *  own hole in the band above it.                                     *

   *  accidentals are drafted with a 2-degree rake, so their tops and    *
   *  the white tops are not parallel and never can be.  The instrument  *
   *  is turned onto its WHITE deck — the plane it is measured from      *
   *  everywhere else, and three quarters of the playing surface — and   *
   *  the accidentals keep their rake, standing off the bed exactly as   *
   *  they stand off the deck in the hand.                               *

# vertices, the same faces, in the same places — and the same objects the
# exported STLs carry, every one of them, checked object by object against
# the browser's own checksums (see PARITY above).  An STL differs from this
# scene ONLY in where the parts stand: it is folded at the spine seam into
# two rows and turned playing-face down for a print bed, and it is merged
# into one mesh per filament colour.  Nothing about the geometry changes in
# the move, and there is nothing in the one that is not in the other.

# FACE TRIANGULATION — ear clipping, NOT a fan
#
# The drafted faces are n-gons and many of them are CONCAVE: the step a
# white key takes around its neighbouring accidentals is cut into the key's
# own top, underside and shoulder faces, so those polygons have reflex
# corners by construction.  A fan from vertex 0 is only valid on a convex
# polygon; on these it lays triangles straight across the notch — a wall
# joining two corners that nothing joins in the sheet, and on a white key
# it paves over the very clearance the key is cut back to provide.
#
# This is a literal transliteration of triangulateFace() in model.js, so
# the Blender build, the WebGL preview and the exported STLs stay the same
# mesh, triangle for triangle.
