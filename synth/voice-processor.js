/* =====================================================================
 *  THE VOICE — one key, one sample at a time
 * =====================================================================
 *
 * Engrave renders a whole score into an AudioBuffer before it plays any of
 * it, because a score is known in advance. A keyboard is not: the note has to
 * start when the key goes down, so the same two oscillators run live here, in
 * the audio thread, a sample at a time.
 *
 * The algorithms are not re-derived. The wavetable path reads the band-limited
 * mip tables built by ../synth/tables.js, which is render-worker.js's own
 * scheme; the filtered path is justidraw's recursion as synth.js transcribes
 * it, with the same feedback pole, the same index and the same high-frequency
 * taper. Those constants are repeated here rather than imported because an
 * AudioWorklet has no module graph to import through — so they are written out
 * once, with the source they came from named beside them.
 *
 * WHY THE ENVELOPE LIVES INSIDE THE OSCILLATOR, not on a GainNode after it.
 * In the filtered family the modulation index is driven by the output, and the
 * output is amplitude-scaled — a quiet note comes out very nearly a sine and a
 * loud one folds into a buzz. That is the whole point of the family. Put the
 * envelope on a gain stage downstream and the fold would be computed at full
 * amplitude and then turned down, so every note would be equally bright and
 * the attack would not open up. So `amp` here is the live envelope value, and
 * the timbre follows the ADSR because the physics say it does.
