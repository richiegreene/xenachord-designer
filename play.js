/* =====================================================================
 *  PLAY — the keyboard as an instrument
 * =====================================================================
 *
 * Two jobs, and the second is the reason the first is worth having.
 *
 * THE SYNTH. Engrave's Playback timbre area, brought over whole: the same two
 * families, the same slider over the same four shapes, the same drawn wave,
 * built by the same createTimbrePicker so the list cannot drift. Beneath it an
 * ADSR editor in the same idiom, because the fold that makes the filtered
 * family bright is driven by amplitude — so the envelope is not a level
 * applied to the timbre, it is part of it, and the two belong in one panel
 * drawn one way.
 *
 * WHICH MODE OWNS THE POINTER. A key is two different things depending on
 * what you are doing, and it must never be both at once:
 *
 *   In Design the strip is a drawing you edit. Clicking a key removes it,
 *   dragging its edge resizes it, a gap takes a drop. Nothing sounds.
 *
 *   In Play the keyboard is an instrument. Pressing a key sounds the pitch
 *   Scale/Tuning assigned it and releasing it lets go; nothing about the
 *   arrangement can be changed by touching it, on the strip or in the 3D
 *   view. A stray click cannot cost you a layout.
 *
 * That is enforced here rather than by disabling each design handler in turn:
 * these listeners sit in the capture phase, ahead of every one of them, and in
 * Play they take the event and stop it. One place to read, and no way for a
 * new design handler added later to quietly become reachable from Play.

 * to avoid. So nothing sounds while it is armed, and the browser's own focus
 * and double-click behaviour is left alone (no preventDefault) so the box can
 * take the caret. Design's handlers stay shut out either way: the event is
